# SlothUnit Package generation

This project is intended to automate the process of package generation for [SlothUnit](https://github.com/Suui/SlothUnit).

* For now [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) is the default option.
* [Releases with the needed files](https://github.com/Suui/SlothUnit.Package/releases) tied to this github project should also be available.
* And a [Conan](https://www.conan.io/) package may appear in the future.
